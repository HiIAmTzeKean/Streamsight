## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]
### Observation 1
A complete global timeline
- Using a population or sample of actions for training doesn't affect a global timeline
What results in a partial global timeline is the act of sampling a **single time as a train-test split**.

What results in no global timeline is
1. Random selection of data (as if there was no time notion)
2. Sample a test time for each test user (e.g., right before user’s last action), and do not observe global timeline across all users. Leave-one-out is an example data split scheme under this setting.
### Observation 2
The defined split patterns observed are summarised below
1. Random split
2. Leave-one-out
3. Single time point
4. Simulation-based online
5. Sliding window
### Observation 3
A common metric used ([[Popularity]]) that is poorly defined across many systems. The question is *how accurate is the popularity in reflecting ground truth*? Since most system do not employ a global timeline, the notion of popularity is simply the frequency of the item. Items with longer history will inevitably top the popularity score.
### Observation 4
Data leakage → Some future test data that should not be know is leaked into the training set.
Use of Leave-k-out without the notion of global timeline could mean that some interaction in the future for other users could be made known when predicting for a specific user. Hence the notion of setting 4 where there is a disregard of global timeline.
### Question 1
My understanding of a global timeline is that it is independent of the actions being the entire dataset or a sample of the dataset. As long as the system is trained on a sliding test time split it can be considered to be a global timeline adhering system.

In the case of partial global timeline, there is only a single time used as the train-test split. This simulates a situation where the recommender system is built as of the test time

As for no global timeline. It would be either that the data is split randomly or in setting 4 of table 1 where a sample test time for each user is used and no global timelines is observed.

*Why does sampling a test time for each user not follow a global timeline?*
Another alternative is to sample a test time for each test user, and hide the test user’s items after that time, without maintaining time consistency across users. This effectively assumes that the sequence in which items are selected is important, not the absolute times when the selections are made (pg 552)
