## Objective
> [!question] how does daisyrec model handle the unknown user

## Material read
1. <https://github.com/recsys-benchmark/DaisyRec-v2.0>
## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]

### Observation 1
DaisyRec uses `UserKNNCF` which inherits from `GeneralRecommender`. It overrides the fit method to compute a similarity matrix. The `TestSplitter` when configured with 'tsbr' cuts the dataset into train and test and returns the indexes. Model is trained on the train_set which is obtained by getting all the relevant train index. The test set is also obtained in the similar fashion.

`build_candidates_set` is called, which creates the item set for ranking. For each user and item in the test set compute the items that we want to test for the user. Now assume $u_1$ not seen in the train set before and has an interaction with $i_1$. Then, `pos_item` will be just $i_1$, the `neg_item` will be all items known in global dataset except for $i_1$. The final sample for this unseen user will be $[i_{1},\text{Other train items}]$. `test_ucands` contains $u_1$ and the test items, while `test_u` will contain $u_1$.

`get_dataloader` is called on `test_ucands` which allows the model to run it as a batch. Then `rank()` is called. The `scores` are computed through `scores = self.pred_mat[us[:, np.newaxis], cands_ids].A`.

Qn: does this mean the algo is just simply using `pred_mat` index to obtain the score?

`pred_mat` is defined by $U_{all} \times I_{all}$ which contains all users and item in the dataset. All known data on $U_{all}$ is first stored in the matrix. Since $u_1$ is not known, then all his interactions will be $0$. The similarity score is computed, thus the KNN to $u_1$ will be stored in the matrix.

I am still convinced that the unknown user will still be computed with some output but I am unable to trace what the output is. To convince myself, I will clone the repo and code trace the dataframe.

### Observation 2
Given a parameter of topk=10 and cand_num=10.  
While running the code, I can confirm that unseen users will have an array of $0$ for `scores`. `scores` is computed from getting the interaction with all item of that user and the corresponding likely score of the test item in that row.  
The scores are then sorted in `rank_ids` to find out how the model will rank the test item in the top k list. 

Considering the case of only unknown user evaluation:

In the case of cand_num (the number of items to sample) < user_item_interaction_count, `rec_ids` will just be the test array itself, and thus it will always obtain a perfect score. Note this is because there will not be negative sampling and thus a perfect score is always obtained for unknown user.

In the case when cand_num>user_item_interaction_count then there will be negative sampling done. `scores` will still be an array of $0$. Then, running `rank_ids = np.argsort(-scores)[:, :self.topk]` will result in a non meaningful sorting of the array. `rec_ids` will be a non-deterministic recommendation for the unknown user. We can say that in this case the unknown users are not handled.
