## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]

### Observation 1
Seems like the answer to know the KNN is done for RecPack is done here  
<https://github.com/LienM/recpack/blob/master/recpack/algorithms/kunn.py>

How it is done is when the test set is passed to `_predict`, it will call a helper function, which gets the top-k similar users for computation. Since we are using the case of an unknown user and some item, there must be interaction for the user/item and thus it does not fall into the `nonzero` filter.

Qn: Does this mean that the match will be on the closest known user even though this user is not seen before?  
Ans: Very likely

Qn: Could the training set have already filtered out the unknown user  
Investigating setting 3 again [here](https://github.com/LienM/recpack/blob/master/recpack/scenarios/timed.py) assuming that some user $u_1$ did not exist before time $t$. Does this mean that $u_1$ will not be in `test_data_in`?  
`self._full_train_X, self._test_data_out = self.timestamp_spl.split(data)` splits the interactions at $t$. Then, followed by `self._test_data_in = self._full_train_X.copy()`. So, we can say with certainty that `self._test_data_in` will not contain $u_1$.

Qn: What does this mean for `self._test_data_out`?  
Ans: Refer to ` X_pred = self._predict_and_postprocess(algorithm, self.test_data_in)` and we can see that only the `self.test_data_in` matters in prediction. Thus, all unknown items are dropped for the known users in RecPack case.

### Observation 2
For Elliot case, I was still unable to find out how the unknown users are handled. Have checked [uknn](https://github.com/sisinflab/elliot/blob/master/elliot/recommender/knn/user_knn/user_knn.py) code but the implementation for the [prediction](https://github.com/sisinflab/elliot/blob/master/elliot/recommender/knn/user_knn/user_knn_similarity.py#L137) seems clean. Will have to investigate further.
