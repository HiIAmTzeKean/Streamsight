## Objective
> [!question] What is the next step after getting the type of train test split

## Material read
1. Had a call with Prof and the next actionable item is to find out for those systems that use a global timeline, how do they handle the data of unseen user or item that are in the test but not in train set
## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]

### Observation 1
Why are we curious in this unknown handling. Take the example of a global timeline of 1 Jan. Assuming there is $u_{1},u_{2}$ which are in the train set and a $u_{3}$ that appears after. Given this new user, how will the system handle the test data during prediction.

Will the machine
1. ignore the test item completely?
2. how is this prediction evaluated?

By understanding how these new users are handled, we will then be able to gauge if this way is fair.
### Observation 2
How they might handle the dataset now
1. Pre filtering might be done first
    1. Once the timestamp is selected, the users or items in the test set will be checked against the train set and all new items are dropped
2. Some threshold filtering might be done based on the rating of the user
    1. This is not entirely correct. This can be illustrated with an example. Before the user picks chicken rice to eat, that could have been his best option. He might give a low rating after eating but this does not reflect that recommending chicken rice at that time is a bad choice.
