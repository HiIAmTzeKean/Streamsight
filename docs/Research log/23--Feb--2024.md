My implementation was following the design of restricting the training set size given to the recommender. For example, the first training window is week 1 to 3. then the next is week 2 to 4 and so on.

After discussion, a second mode can also be configured such that the training data is incrementally increased and a new test set of the next window is used. Essentially the old test set becomes the next incremental train data.

### Keep in view
Can make the system more complex
- recommendation can be different depending on the context something that we can play with in (yelp)  
If asked to recommend a place when I'm in NTU, it could give something at airport which may not be ideal. This recommendation should be penalised. In order to simulate such an instance, we should make the system extendable to such a testing use case.

The use case can be as such. Assume that we are giving recsys additional information in hopes for a more accurate recommendation. This would be done in the testing stage where more info such as user and location id can be provided and the recommendation given can be tested based on some known ground truth.
