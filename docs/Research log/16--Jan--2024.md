## Objective
>[!question] Why does more data degrade the performance of the machine

## Material read
1. [[sunTakeFreshLook2023]]
## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]
### Observation 1
User preference is inferred from the interactions of the target user and other users who display similar interactions. When a global timeline is not observed, there is loss in context information pertaining to the preference that that particular instance.
### Observation 2
From observation 1, when the number of interactions are recent relative to a test point, the test accuracy is likely to be higher.
### Observation 3
The act of observing a global timeline would be to simply
1. order the data in chronological order
2. then incrementally train the model with a sliding window
The number of windows to use for retraining is a hyperparam that can be tuned
