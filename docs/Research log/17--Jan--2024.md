## Reflection
![[Guiding questions]]
### Observation 1
I note that for MS recommenders the rationale for using a random split is as follows
> Instead of cutting a total percentage, for each user we cut a relative ratio of the rated items. For example, if user1 has rated 4 items and user2 10, cutting 25% will correspond to 1 and 2.6 ratings in the test set, approximated as 1 and 3 according to the round() function. In this way, the 0.75 ratio is satisfied both locally and globally, preserving the original distribution of ratings across the train and test set.
