### Observation 1
`splitting_passed_timestamp` gets a fixed timestamp and cuts the frame into train and test and returns it. The test set will not be stored in the model. The train set is stored in the model as `self._ratings`. In `get_recommendations()` when obtaining the recommendations for the test set, the model tries to predict the recommendation for all users in the train set.

Suppose now $u_1$ is in the test but not train set, then $u_1$ will not have a generated recommendation list and thus will not be evaluated. The user can be said to be ignored by the system for evaluation.
