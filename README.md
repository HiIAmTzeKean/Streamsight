# Streamsight

![streamsight-logo](assets/streamsight-logo.png)

Streamsight is an offline Reccomender Systems (RecSys) evaluation toolkit that respects a global timeline.
The aim is to partition the data into different windows where data is incrementally released for the programmer
to fit, train and submit predictions. This aims to provide a close simulation of an online setting when evaluating
RecSys algorithms.
