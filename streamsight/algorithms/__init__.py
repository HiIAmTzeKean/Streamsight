"""
The algorithms module in streamsight contains a wide array of state-of-the-art
collaborative filtering algorithms.
Also included are some baseline algorithms, as well as several reusable building blocks
such as commonly used loss functions and sampling methods.

.. currentmodule:: streamsight.algorithms

Algorithm
---------
Base class for all algorithms. Programmer should inherit from this class when implementing
a new algorithm.

Item Similarity Algorithms
----------------------------

Item similarity algorithms exploit relationships between items to make recommendations.
At prediction time, the user is represented by the items
they have interacted with.
